==Training data==

tweets_5000_page{1-3}.json and tweets_8_9_May_2016_page{1-2}.json contain only aurora activity. The days from May 8th and 9th from 2016 there was a huge Aurora activity, so there are more tweets in those days than in others.

Labeled_data.json is a labeled-by-hand dataset with 1000 tweets. This is what we should expand.
